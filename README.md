        print(actor)
    }
}

// WARM UPS
// 1. Print the name of the first movie.

if let name = aMovie["name"] as? String {
    print("The name of first movie is \(name)")
    }


// 2. Print a list of all movie names, preferably on one line.
    var movieNames = [String]()
    for dict in movies {
        if var movname = dict["name"] as? String {
      movieNames.append(movname)
        }
    }
for i in 0..<movieNames.count {
    print(movieNames[i], terminator: " ")
}


print(" ")

// 3. Print a list of all movie years and names as follows:
// 2015: Minions
// 2001: Shrek
// .
// .
// .

for dict in movies {
    if var movname = dict["name"] as? String, movyear = dict["year"] as? Int { print("\(movyear): \(movname)")
    }
}




// 4. Iterate over all movies. Inside the loop use switch on genre. Print each title
// and add an appropriate emoji to represent its genre

for movie in movies {
    switch movie {
    case if var  movie["name"] = "Minion":
        print (movie["name"])
    default:
        break

    }


}


// 5. In code, not by literal initialization, create a new dictionary called moviesByName of type
// [String:[String:Any]]. Copy the elements of movies, adding each to moviesByName
// with the name as key. Sort by name.



// 6. Do the same thing as in (5) for year and genre, creating a new dictionary for each one.
// What happens, and why? How might you change your approach?

// THE PROJECT
// Iterate over all movies and print a formatted blurb about each one. Use this out put of the
// first movie as a guide:

// Minions came out in 2015. It was an animation staring Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, and Michael Keaton.
// Barack Obama was president that year.


// Note how it should generate "an animation" in contrast to "a drama"
// Similarly notice the "and" before the last member of the cast listed.
// Get it to work any which way you can but try your best to follow these guidelines
//   * Don't use forced unwrapping
//   * Use multiple bindings in one "if let" (no pyramid of doom)
